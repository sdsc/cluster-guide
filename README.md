# cluster-guide

The repo contains documentation on building a Rocks(r) Cluster. There are currently two parts:

- [Quickstart Guide](quickstart/)
- [Advanced Guide](advanced/)

While referencing the official Rocks(r) Users Guide, the Quickstart Guide is intended to get the
beginning cluster admin off the ground as quickly as possible. Where more advanced information is
available, either in the Rocks(s) Users Guide or elsewhere we will point you to it. Reading it is
recommended but not strictly necessary unless you have problems.

The purpose of the Advanced Guide is to take you through some more advanced an detailed examples
of cluster administration. From building compiler rolls to using IPMI to power off/on your cluster
nodes to building a virtual cluster to use as a testing environment.

Please feel free to fork these docs to make them specific to your installation. We are happy to
review pull requests to add documentation that can benefit the community.
